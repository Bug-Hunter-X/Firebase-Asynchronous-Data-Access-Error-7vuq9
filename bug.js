The issue stems from the asynchronous nature of Firebase operations.  If you attempt to access data from a Firebase query before it has fully resolved, you'll receive undefined. This often occurs when you chain operations without proper error handling or asynchronous flow control. For instance, if you directly use the data from a `get()` call without using `.then()` or `async/await`, it will likely fail.

```javascript
// Problematic Code
const snapshot = await db.collection('myCollection').doc('myDoc').get();
const myData = snapshot.data(); // myData might be undefined if the get() operation is still pending
console.log(myData.someField); // Error: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'someField')
```
